Mesa All Sky Camera setup notes:
--------------------------------
On allsky.lowell.edu
1) installed a vanilla version of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
2) GoQat:
 a) I imported the goqat-2.0.0.tar.gz from canburytech.net/GoQat
    wget http://canburytech.net/GoQat/download/goqat-2.0.0.tar.gz
 b) tar xvfz goqat-2.0.0.tar.gz
 c) Install a bunch of stuff that GoQat will need to compile:


# needs gtk+-3.0 and a few other things
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt-get install libgoocanvas-2.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
sudo apt-get install libxpa-dev

# download ds9 and xpa executables
http://ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html
  e.g.  wget http://ds9.si.edu/download/linux64/ds9.linux64.7.4.tar.gz
        wget http://ds9.si.edu/download/linux64/xpa.linux64.2.1.14.tar.gz

  copy these binaries to /usr/local/bin

f) ./configure
g) make
h) sudo make install
    This installs everything under /usr/local/ by default.

3) SAO DS9: Download ds9 from ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html
   tar xvfz ds9*.gz
   sudo mv ds9 /usr/local/bin

   install libXss for ds9
     yum install libXScrnSaver

4) Plug in the Oculus camera to a usb port.  
   The camera will show up on /dev/bus/usb/00M/0NN and the permission
   will need to be made world readable

   csh> sudo chmod 0666 `lsusb | grep Starlight | sed -e 's/://' |\
        awk '{print "/dev/bus/usb/"$2"/"$4}' -`

   this is now implemented in a script in doc/starlight_usb_on

5) install a VNC viewer: (vncviewer)



To work in python you need a few more, if you don't have them:
